Important Notes:

1. This website is built as a personal Islamic toolkit by Creative Men (Muhammad Abdullah).
2. Hijri date conversion logic uses the Moment Hijri library from CDN.
3. Base64-encoded logo increases page weight — recommended to use optimized `.webp` in production.
4. The site uses external Google Fonts and JS libraries — offline mode requires local versions.
5. If uploading to Netlify/GitHub Pages, ensure file names use lowercase and no spaces.
6. Fully static site — no server or PHP required.
